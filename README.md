Enhanced-SharpSSH
=================

This is a fork of the Enhanced version of SharpSSH by Ketul. The difference is that this version is built with an updated .NET framework and uses System.Security.Cryptograph module instead of Org.Mentalis.Security.Cryptography for encryption.

I am going to add some more features, such as checking file existence, Recursively create directories, etc.
